				<li class="tweak">Wounds that have their removal requirements met while the patient is on a stasis bed will now be cured of their wounds as expected. In addition, burn wounds will slowly recover while stasis'd if they have flesh regen/sanitizer applied</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Examining a bleeding dead body now reflects that dead bodies don't actually bleed, saying their blood is pooling instead</li>
				<li class="tweak">Coagulant is now slightly less effective per bleeding wound for each bleed wound on a patient</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Introduces medical wounds, new injuries that can happen to fleshy carbons when they sustain lots of damage on a bodypart. There's quite a lot of change here, but you can read the guide at: https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Guide_to_wounds and an extended changelog is available here: https://hackmd.io/l_FI9b3tSqa_woDadewJXA</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Introduces scars and temporal scarring! Healing a wound leaves a scar behind that can be seen by examining someone twice rapidly, and if Temporal Scarring is enabled in character prefs, surviving a round with scars will save them to be granted at roundstart another round! Let your body tell stories!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bleeding is now fully bodypart-focused, and 95% of bleeding comes from cut wounds from sharp weapons. Gauze is applied on a limb-by-limb basis, and helps staunch bloodflow rather than totally stop it. Notably, you no longer bleed just from having 40+ brute damage on a limb.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Organic bodyparts are no longer disabled at maximum damage, but are easier to cause wounds to</li>
				<li class="rscadd">O2 medkits in emergency lockers have been replaced with new emergency medkits with basic tools for diagnosing and treating wounds and basic damage</li>
				<li class="tweak">Herapin now rapidly increases bleeding on all open cuts, rather than causing bleeding by itself. The more cuts on the target, the more it will affect them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Neckgrab table slams now hit the targeted limb rather than just the head, with a large chance to dislocate or break a bone</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sharp weapons and burning weapons can now shred zones on jumpsuits, disabling protection on that limb. Damaged clothes can be repaired with cloth.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slaughter demons now deal less raw damage, but gain the ability to cause cut wounds, which becomes more powerful with each attack on a humanoid but resets when bloodcrawling.</li>
